# RAG-using-Spring-AI

## Introduction

Rag-using-Spring-AI is a Spring Boot application designed to demonstrate the use of AI embeddings and vector stores for processing and retrieving information from PDF documents. The project integrates various components such as embedding models, vector stores, and PDF readers to provide a seamless pipeline for extracting, embedding, and storing text from PDF files.

## Features

- **Spring Boot Integration**: Leverages the power of Spring Boot for dependency injection and application configuration.
- **PDF Processing**: Reads and processes text from PDF documents.
- **Text Embeddings**: Uses embedding models to convert text into vector representations.
- **Vector Store**: Stores the vectorized representations for efficient retrieval.

## Project Structure
- src/main/java/com/example/demo: Contains the main application class and configuration.
- src/main/java/com/example/demo/configuration: Contains configuration classes for PDF reading and processing.
- src/main/resources: Contains application properties and PDF resources.
